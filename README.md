# Tree Node Detection Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Tree Node Detection Project! This project aims to develop a method for accurately locating tree nodes in images by determining their characteristics, such as size and eccentricity. The implementation explores two distinct approaches: one based on thresholding and another utilizing the Hough Circle Transform. The goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for detecting both small and large tree nodes in diverse images.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Images are loaded from a specified folder and converted to grayscale.
   - Preprocessing steps, including Gaussian filtering, thresholding, and morphological operations, are applied to enhance node visibility.

2. **Thresholding Approach:**
   - The thresholding approach focuses on detecting large tree nodes.
   - Regions of interest are filtered based on their size and eccentricity.
   - A disjunctive case strategy is implemented, initially attempting to detect large nodes and, if unsuccessful, switching to the detection of small nodes.

3. **Hough Circle Transform Approach:**
   - The Hough Circle Transform is employed for the detection of small tree nodes.
   - The method utilizes edge detection, gradient computation, and the Hough Circle Transform to identify circular structures.
   - Performance is assessed on both small and large nodes separately.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-image`
- `scipy`
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib scikit-image scipy numpy opencv-python scikit-learn
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tree-node-detection.git
cd tree-node-detection
```

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Tree_Node_Detection_Project.ipynb
```

Explore the notebook to understand the implementation and experiment with different images.

## Results and Analysis

The project provides insights into the strengths and limitations of both approaches. The thresholding method excels in detecting large nodes, while the Hough Circle Transform performs well for small nodes. However, challenges arise when both types coexist in an image. The disjunctive case strategy may lead to information loss in such scenarios.

## Future Improvements

Future enhancements could include:

- Integration of modern methods based on convolutional neural networks for improved generalization.
- Optimization of parameters for adaptive preprocessing and better adaptation to varying conditions.
- Development of a unified approach for simultaneous detection of both small and large nodes in complex images.
